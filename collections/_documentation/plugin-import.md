Attributes names are case-sensitive, and fields with a ✅ are mandatory.

You will have to delete the imported customers if you plan to re-import a file.

### User handling

If Kimai creates new users on the fly, make sure that you configured the default timezone for new users at [System > Settings]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) before the import.
The user timezone is used when importing the timesheets. 
If you import users from different timezones, you need to create the users upfront manually.

## Clockify (Timesheet)

Want to switch from Clockify to Kimai? Export the data in Clockify, open it in Excel and export it as CSV file.

The following CSV structure is expected, each column is ✅ mandatory. Import will not work if one of these columns is missing:

**BE AWARE** you have to choose the correct date-format in toggl, otherwise you will see errors like:

## Grandtotal (Customer)

There is a [plugin for Mac invoicing software Grandtotal]({% link _store/keleo-grandtotal-plugin-for-kimai.md %}), which adds support for Kimai.

In case your leading system for customers is Grandtotal, you can import customers from a Grandtotal CSV export into Kimai.
Grandtotal calls CSV exports `Numbers` in the export screen.

Attention: Grandtotal exports its data with column names in the UI language (just like Kimai).
Kimai only supports imports for GT exports from the languages english and german, so you might have to change it in `Settings / Languages / User interface`.
