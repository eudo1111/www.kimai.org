The Kimai dashboard displays so-called `widgets`, which can be reordered, added, or removed.

Each user can configure their own dashboard directly via the frontendâ€”no special permissions are required for editing your personal layout.

However, some widgets may require specific permissions (for example, those showing project budgets). As a result, different user roles may see different sets of available widgets.

## Editing the Dashboard

Click the {% include demo-action-button.html icon="preferences" title="Preferences" %} button in the top-right corner to switch to edit mode.

- Removing widgets: If you delete a widget from the dashboard, you must manually click the Save button to apply the change.
- Reordering widgets: If you reoder widget on the dashboard, you must manually click the Save button to apply the change.
- Adding widgets: When you add a widget, all pending changes are saved automatically.

> Note: The arrangement of widgets in edit mode may look slightly different from how it appears in the normal display mode. This is expected.
